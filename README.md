# 🖼️ Image Classification Notebook

## 📝 Project Overview
This project develops accurate and robust image classification models using deep learning. We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with techniques like data augmentation, batch normalization, dropout, and transfer learning to enhance accuracy and generalization.

## 📌 Models Implemented

- 🐱🐶 Cat and Dog Classification: A model to distinguish between cats and dogs with 98% accuracy.  

- 🔢 Digit Recognizer: A classifier for handwritten digit recognition (MNIST dataset) with a competition score of 0.98.


## 🔑 Key Features
- CPU vs GPU performance
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Pre-processing: normalization, reshaping, data augmentation
- CNN models using TensorFlow and Keras with fine-tuning (Activation function, BatchNorm, padding, filter size, max pooling, dropout) 
- Model prediction
- Saving best models for future use
- Making predictions on unseen data
- Evaluation: classification report, confusion matrix

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Software:
    - Python 3.x
    - Cloud-based or browser-based notebook environments (Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle Notebooks, Google Colab ...)

- Skills:
    - Advanced knowledge in statistical machine learning and deep learning, with a focus on CNNs
    - Proficiency in Python, including NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow
