# 🖼️ Image Classification Notebook

## 📝 Project Overview
This project develops accurate and robust image classification models using deep learning. We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with techniques like data augmentation, batch normalization, dropout, and transfer learning to enhance accuracy and generalization.

## 📌 Models Implemented

- 🐱🐶 Cat and Dog Classification: A model to distinguish between cats and dogs.
- 🔢 Digit Recognizer: A classifier for handwritten digit recognition (MNIST dataset).


## 🔑 Key Features
- CPU vs GPU performance
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Pre-processing: normalization, reshaping, data augmentation
- CNN models using TensorFlow and Keras with fine-tuning (BatchNorm, padding, filter size, max pooling, dropout) 
- Model prediction
- Saving best models for future use
- Making predictions on unseen data
- Evaluation: classification report, confusion matrix

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Software:
    - Python 3.x
    - Jupyter Notebook - Google Colab - Kaggle
    - Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OS, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn . These dependencies can be installed using pip commands in your environment.
